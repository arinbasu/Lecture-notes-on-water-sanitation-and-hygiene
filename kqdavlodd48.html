<div>In a series of publications on water, sanitation and hygiene, Bartram and Cairncross (2010) provided an overview of WSH &nbsp;Water, sanitation and health are three components of public health and diarrhoea and subsequent malnutirition adds considerably to burden of diseases, mortality, morbidity and national costs. Following TB, malaria, and HIV/AIDS, diarrhoea is the next major killer disease for children particularly in the developing countries and contribute to about 4 million deaths worldwide. Diarrhoea also leads to malnutrition due to loss of water and nutrients. Poor hand washing leads to lack of use of water to wash face and eyes, as a result, trachoma infections are common in countries where hand washing and face washing are not practiced. Improper sanitation or removal of faeces promote hookwork and other intestinal nematode infections such as Ascaris infection. The intestinaal parasitic infections then lead to further worsening of malnutrition. Besides these, due to abdominal pain and other symptoms, children skip schools sometimes for days, and this in turn lead to loss of time. In addition to loss of time due to infections, there is also loss of time for women who have to fetch water over long distances, and people who have to look for places to defecate. About 800 million people would still defecate out in the open even if the millenial development goals are met to 100% and with over population, new goals will need to be drafted as even with attainment of these goals, there would still be people who would not have piped water supply and safe disposal of faeces.&nbsp;</div><div>Developed countries are not exempt from such considerations either. Although the coverage of safe disposal of faeces is higher in the developed world, there is still no guarantee as to the quality of the sanitation and how the risk of faecal contamination of the drinking water sources are avoided or addressed. Several water borne diseases have been reported worldwide in countries such as Canada; in New Zealand, in 2016, a waterborne disease outbreak occurred in Havelock North and was attributed to faceal contamination of water. As in developing countries, hand washing promotion in developed countries have shown reduction by 50% of gastrointestinal infections in child care centres and in Australia about 42% caregivers were found to practice regular hand washing. </div><div>Water supply, sanitation (disposal of faeces) and promotion of hand washing with water and soap requires intersectoral collaboration and active government intervention. This is particularly problematic in poor and underdeveloped regions in the world or lower socioeconomic strata, yet you will see that while government could have assisted with piped water supply delivery systems or help with building of latrines, such effects are lacking. Health sector professionals need to engage with other sectors to promote these services. </div>
