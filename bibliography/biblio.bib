  annote = {Water supply systems for sustaining health has six qualities (quality of the water being provided, quantity of the water at the rate of 1.5 l/person/day for basic activities of sanitation and cooking, and 50 l/person/day for washing and other activities, and on an average of 1000 cu.m per year per head; access to the water must be less than 1000 m, reliability of the water must be that good quality of water to be supplied throughout the year, cost of the water to the user should be such that it can be borne easily, and the ease of management of the water supply should not be too hard. Good quality adequate water supply (and lack of it) has health consequences that are both acute and chronic: acute health effect is diarrhoea, and chronic health effects are not only chronic diarrhoea, malnutrition and downstream effects, but also poisoning from heavy metals and chemicals (arsenic  and fluoride); however, diarrhoeal diseases are highlighted most often. These are problems with both developed and developing countries. For developing countries, the problems are in ensuring availability and maintenance of fresh adquate water supply; for developed world, the issues are dissociation between health care aspects of water supply; in the past, medical community and public health community would take a bigger responsibility and role in ensuring availablity of good quality adequate water supply; now, water provision is more technical and as a result, many authorities who provide water do not have sufficient knowledge about the health consequences of drinking water supply: when that happens, outbreaks occur even in developed countries. There are issues around water supply provisions and there are disparities there. We know that under five mortality is correlated with low per capita GDP and low percentage of improved water supply. We also know that per capita GDP is associated with improved water supply to some extent. We know for instance that low developed parts of the world are often reliant on ground water as they may not have adequate rainfall the year round, unlike most developed countries. As rainfall helps to replenish groundwater, the risks of depleiton of groundwater is higher in poor and developing countries. Further, there is a cost of ownership and provision of high quality water to households. However, as most families and households are used to not pay anything yet they obtain low quality water from sources that are not improved such as tanks; as a result, they are loathe to pay when improved water supply provisions are made available. Therefore there is a case for making high quality water supply to them at modest cost sharing options. This is all the more needed as provision of good quality piped water systems will not only help to reduce diarrhoeal and other diseases, but they will also help to alleviate the issues around sanitation.},
