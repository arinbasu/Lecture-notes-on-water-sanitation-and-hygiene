<div>Sanitation refers to the process of safe and clean disposal of faeces and sewage. By safe disposal is meant that the faeces and urine will be deposited hygienically, and in a way that they would not have any chance to come in contact with water used for drinking or bathing purposes, or that, the sewage would then be carried or disposed of and treated in a way so that there would be no chance or very little chance of this to contaminate food or water for consumption. Thus sanitation would indicate that people would have access to latrines where after deposition of urine or faeces, these biological wastes are washed away or deposited deep into the soil and in enclosed, as opposed to open defecation where they either come in contact with water, or humans in some ways or flies or other agents that can then contaminate food and water supply.</div><div></div>
