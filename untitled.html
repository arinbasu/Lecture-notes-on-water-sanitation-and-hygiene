<h2 data-label="164330" class="ltx_title_subsection">Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene</h2><div>We will review the principles of water supply, sanitation, and hygiene (washing of hands with soap and water) and their prevalence and health effects. Water supply here refers to the provision of drinking water and water for food preparation, and use in personal hygiene (washing oneself). This water will need to be fresh water. We refer access to fresh drinking water carried to households through pipes from a source from where the water is filtered and made suitable for human consumption and usage as "piped water supply". This is the most desirable access to water. We refer access to "improved" water supply as a situation where even though the water is not carried through pipe from the source to the household, water is nevertheless available in the form of groundwater that is extracted using a handpump, or water that is accessed using a tap installed at a public facility or a fountain installed and maintained by an authority</div><div></div>
